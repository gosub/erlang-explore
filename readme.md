## turing_tape

A module to simulate an infinite tape, in both direction, subdivided in cells where symbols can be written. Used in the turing_machine module. The tape api is made of the possible operations defined by Alan Turing in its paper "On Computable Numbers, With An Application To The Entscheidungsproblem" i.e.: left, right, write X, read. The tape is implemented as [zipper data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipper_\(data_structure\)).
